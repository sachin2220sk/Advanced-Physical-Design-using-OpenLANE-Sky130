![](Images_Day_1/Advanced-Physical-Design-using-OpenLANE_Sky130_1.png)

This GitHub repository will demonstrate the work done in Advanced-Physical-Design-using-OpenLANE-Sky130 workshop which is organized by VLSI System Design also called VSD. The main aim of this workshop is to give hands-on experiences on SoC design planning in OpenLANE flow using Google-SkyWater 130nm process design kit (pdk).
